### [Whole Project Demo Here](http://sophie-nz.monster/)
## Introduction
- This repository mainly serves as a coding sample of my front-end skill. Most of the graphic contents/components were actually my exercise compilation before for learning HTML/CSS/Sass from zero. I just glued them together component by component.
- This graphic design project is only the front end part to a whole project for displaying my profile, using Webpack to compile the .scss files to css format and bundle .js files,and for back-end using PHP MVC framework to display dynamic contents from MySQL database. [Backend PHP MVC framework](https://github.com/hong-cai/php-MVC-panel-adminLTE-bootstrap-javascript)

- The design of this colorful profile page used 5 colors,which is more than designing a typical website. The purpose of that was to create a 'Game Style Theme' that displays bright eye-catching effect to the readers.
- This page design is fully responsive that adapts easily across most devices.
